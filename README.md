**AliToDaraz** is an essential tool for **dropshippers**, **importers**, and **smart shoppers** in Bangladesh. It serves as a bridge between **Alibaba.com** and **Daraz.com.bd**, allowing you to instantly find local availability of products you see on Alibaba.

## 🌟 Why use this tool?
If you are looking for **"Ali to Daraz"**, **"Alibaba to Daraz converter"**, or **"Search Alibaba products on Daraz"**, this extension is for you. It solves the problem of manually searching by using:
*   **Visual Search / Image Search**: Finds products even with different names.
*   **Price Comparison**: Checks if buying locally on Daraz is cheaper than importing.
*   **Sourcing Helper**: great for validating product demand in the BD market.
